Spleen F.A.Q.

1) Could you add bold variants of the fonts?

	I'm generally not a fan of bold characters for monospaced fonts,
	and it is not possible to have bold characters for the 5x8, 6x12
	and 8x16 variants because most characters would overlap with each
	other.

	Moreover, there was no bold support in text mode on IBM PC, and
	framebuffer consoles on Linux, OpenBSD, and NetBSD do not support
	bold characters either.

	Color highlighting should be preferred instead.



2) How are wsfont header files (for OpenBSD and NetBSD) generated?

	The files are manually generated in two steps:

	- Exporting the BDF files to PSF using the gbdfed editor, selecting
	  only characters from the first page (Basic Latin and Latin-1
	  Supplement Unicode blocks).

	- Running the output through psf2bsd(1) from the psftools package.
	  The files are then edited to add empty glyphes for the C1 Controls
	  characters in the 0x80 through 0x9F range.
